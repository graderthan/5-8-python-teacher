# Welcome to our Intro to Python Course Repository! 🌟

Hello, amazing educators! 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫

We're thrilled to share with you this repository, a treasure trove of resources for teaching Python to 5th through 8th graders. This isn't your typical course content – it's a journey into the exciting world of Python programming, tailored specifically for young, curious minds!

## What's Inside? 📦

This repository holds a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are more than just a learning tool; they're a playground for students to engage with and create applications, all while learning Python. And guess what? They get to play with a virtual turtle! 🐢

## Course Structure 🏗️

The course is neatly divided into 7 comprehensive modules. Each module comes with its own interactive notebooks, a set of challenge problems to test understanding, and detailed lesson plans to guide your teaching journey.

### 1. **Variables and Calculations**
   Dive into the world of variables and basic arithmetic operations. Students will learn how to store data and perform calculations, a fundamental skill in programming.

### 2. **Input/Output**
   Discover the magic of interaction! Students learn how to use `input` to gather data and `print` to display information, making their code converse with users.

### 3. **Conditional Statements and Logical Expressions**
   Introduce decision-making in code. This module explores how programs can make choices using conditional statements and logical operators.

### 4. **Loops**
   Unravel the power of repetition in coding with loops. This is where students learn to automate tasks efficiently.

### 5. **Lists**
   Jump into managing collections of data. Lists are powerful tools for organizing and manipulating multiple pieces of information.

### 6. **Functions**
   Functions are like mini-programs within your program. This module helps students understand how to create and use these handy blocks of code.

### 7. **Click Listening**
   Here, students learn to make their applications interactive by responding to mouse clicks. It's a fun way to bring their creations to life!

## Why Jupyter Notebooks? 📘✨

Jupyter Notebooks offer an interactive coding environment that's perfect for learning. Students can write, run, and tweak their code all in one place, seeing the results of their efforts in real-time. It's a hands-on experience that keeps learning dynamic and engaging.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started, simply clone or download this repository into your **Grader Than
Workspace**. 

1) After opening your **Grader Than Workspace**, open the terminal by pressing: 
   - **`ctrl shift p`** (PC) 
   - **`cmd shift p`** (Mac)

2) In the command pallet at the top of the screen type "Terminal: Create new terminal"
3) In the terminal window that appears at the bottom of the screen type the
   following command and press enter: `git clone
   https://github.com/graderthan/5-8-python-teacher.git`
4) Your done! You'll now see a file named "5-8-python-teacher" in your Grader
   Than Workspace files on the left side of the screen.

Each module is self-contained, so feel free to navigate through
them in the order that best suits your curriculum.

We believe that learning to code should be fun, interactive, and accessible. With these resources, we hope to ignite a passion for programming in your students and equip them with the skills to explore the vast universe of coding.

Happy teaching! 🍎💻🌈
