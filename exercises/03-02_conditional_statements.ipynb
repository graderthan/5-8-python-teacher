    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Initially, \"Wear sunglasses!\" is printed when `it_is_sunny =\n",
    "True`. This happens because once Python encounters an `if` statement that\n",

    "as `it_is_raining` is `True`. \n",

    "elif condition_2:\n",

    "\n",
    "This syntax is a series of conditional statements in Python, using `if`, `elif`, and again `elif`. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if condition_1:`**\n",
    "   - This is the first check. Python looks at `condition_1` and asks, \"Is this true?\"\n",
    "   - If `condition_1` is `True`, it runs the code inside `do_something()` right below it.\n",
    "   - The code under this `if` must be indented to show it's part of the `if`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`elif condition_2:`**\n",
    "   - `elif` stands for \"else if.\" It's the next step if the first `if` isn't true.\n",
    "   - Python checks `condition_2`. If `condition_1` was `False`, but `condition_2` is `True`, it runs the code in `do_something()` below `elif`.\n",
    "   - Just like `if`, the code under `elif` should be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`elif condition_2:`**\n",
    "   - This is another `elif` with the same `condition_2`. It's likely a typo or mistake because repeating the same condition doesn't make sense. Each `elif` should have a unique condition.\n",
    "   - If you meant a different condition (say `condition_3`), Python would check it only if both `condition_1` and `condition_2` were `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this syntax lets Python check multiple conditions, one after another. If the first condition is `True`, it does something and skips the rest. If not, it checks the next `elif`, and so on. If you meant to have different conditions for each `elif`, remember to change `condition_2` in the last `elif` to something else (like `condition_3`) for it to work logically."

    "moves forward. Even instruct him to go \"home,\" and he'll head back to the start.\n",
    "Let's explore how we can make this happen using if-statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we've started with some code that lets you control `squirtle` using\n",
    "keyboard inputs. Let's dive in and see how it works! \n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "user_input = input(\"What do you want to do?\")\n",

    "    squirtle.home()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what each part of this code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Asking for User Input:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user_input = input(\"What do you want to do?\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line shows a message asking, \"What do you want to do?\" and waits for you to type something in. Once you type your answer and press Enter, whatever you typed gets saved in a variable called `user_input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deciding What to Do Based on Input:**\n",
    "   The following lines are where the magic happens. Python looks at what you typed and decides what to do:\n",

    "     ```python\n",

    "         squirtle.right(90)\n",

    "   - **Move Forward:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     elif user_input == \"forward\" or user_input == \"f\":\n",
    "         squirtle.forward(100)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     If you typed \"forward\" or \"f\", `squirtle` will move straight forward 100 units. This is like saying, \"Go ahead, `squirtle`!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Go Home:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     elif user_input == \"home\" or user_input == \"h\":\n",
    "         squirtle.home()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     If you typed \"home\" or \"h\", `squirtle` will go back to its starting position. It's like giving `squirtle` a command to return to where it began.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code turns your keyboard into a remote control for `squirtle`. Depending on what you type, `squirtle` will turn right, move forward, or go back home. It's a fun way to see how your input can guide `squirtle` around the screen! üê¢üíªüïπÔ∏è\n",
